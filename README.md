# weather-app-webpage
This is my second project based on my learnings of frontend and JavaScript. This is completely done by me, from designing and executing using my skills while doing this project. It's a simple webpage showing live weather data using the weatherapi.com -'s API. When loading the page the first time, using the GEOLOCATION Object of JavaScript, I am accessing the user's location to fetch their current location's weather when the user loads the webpage. I have also added dynamic background colour changing in accordance with the weather by accessing style property through JavaScript.
